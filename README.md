# medical-sales-forecasting
A data science project in which I gathered real time data through offline surveys and google forms. The data is cleaned using pandas and Sales column was created using customer footfall (EDA). Visualizations were made from multiple perspectives. Two ML model ( Random forest regressor and XGBoost) was used to predict sales.
